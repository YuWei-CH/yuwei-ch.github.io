# Yuwei (Peter) Sun — Portfolio

Astro + Tailwind site showcasing my work in high-performance computing, GPU optimization, and research across Flatiron Institute and Scalable Architecture Lab.

## What’s inside
- **Sections:** News, About, Work Experience, Research (publications), Education, Projects, Involvement, Creative Interests.
- **Pages:** Home (`/`), Involvement (`/involvement`), Creative Interests (`/hobbies`).
- **Config:** All content lives in `src/config.ts` (bio, social, skills, projects, experience, research, education, memberships, hobbies).

## Local development
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
Then open the printed localhost URL (default `http://localhost:4321/`).

## Deployment
Build static assets with:
```bash
npm run build
```
Deploy the `dist/` output to your preferred static host (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, etc.).

## TODO
- Add involvement section content.
- Upload photo.
- Update poem.
- Check other sessions.
- Change domain.
